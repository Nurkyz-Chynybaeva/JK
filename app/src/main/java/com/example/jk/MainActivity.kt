//Hob: Can we have a talk this morning, sir, about food, about
//breakfasts and lunches and dinners, and so on? It is a subject that
//interests me very much.
//Mr. Priestley: Certainly, Hob. But
//Lizzie could tell you more about this. She
//is the person who cooks our meals.
//Hob: What did she cook for breakfast
//today, sir?
//Mr. Priestley: We had fruit, boiled
//eggs, toast, bread and butter, marmalade
//and tea.
//Olaf: I had a breakfast this morning
//that I enjoyed very much; a cereal1
//, bacon and eggs, marmalade, toast, coffee.
//I think there is nothing like an English
//breakfast.
//Lucille: No bacon and eggs in the morning for me, thank
//you. My breakfast is always rolls and coffee.
//Frieda: You can’t drink English coffee, can you?
//Lucille: Luckily, at my hotel, there is a cook who is French;
//so I can drink French coffee.


//Mr. Priestley: So you don’t like English coffee?
//Lucille: Oh, no! English people can’t make good coffee.
//Olaf: That’s true. Their bacon, their bread, their butter, their
//tea are always good; their coffee is always bad.
//Mr. Priestley: Where must I go to get good coffee?
//Lucille: Come to France; we always make good coffee there.
//Jan: I like Polish coffee; our coffee is always good.
//Olaf: Come and taste the coffee that we make in Sweden.
//There is none like it.
//Frieda: We make lovely coffee in Switzerland — coffee with
//thick cream in it.
//Mr. Priestley: Pedro, you know many countries. You must
//give us your ideas.

//Pedro: Well, the coffee of South America is really first-class.
//Then I got some Egyptian coffee in Cairo that I enjoyed very
//much. I drank some good coffee in Turkey. The Dutch know
//how to make coffee. It is always good in Portugal.
//Mr. Priestley: And what about England?
//Pedro: In England I always drink tea.
//Mr. Priestley: Thank you. I now know where I can get
//good coffee.
//All the Students: Where is it, sir? It is in my country, isn’t it?
//Mr. Priestley: It seems to be in all countries except England.
//Hob: Do you know the story about the man who was having
//breakfast in an English hotel? He took a drink from his cup and
//then said to the waiter, “Waiter, is this tea or coffee?”
//The waiter said, “Can’t you tell the difference, sir, by the
//taste?”
//“No,” the man said, “I can’t.”
//“Well,” answered the waiter, “if you can’t tell the difference,
//what does it matter which it is?”
//Pedro: I think there is a sameness about English dinners that
//makes them uninteresting — boiled potatoes, roast beef that is
//often burned or not cooked enough, cabbage that is watery1
//and
//tasteless.
//Olaf: Well, you can say what you like, but give me my English breakfast and English food generally.
//Jan: I think Olaf is right. Good roast beef, nicely-browned
//roast potatoes, and...
//Hob (interrupting): I know a song about roast beef. (Sings.)
//I am sorry that is the only line that I know.
//Lucille: We are not sorry. The line that you sang was quite
//enough.
//Jan: As I was saying when Hob interrupted me, where can
//you get roast beef like English beef?
//Olaf: Or mutton like English mutton?2
//Pedro: Or soup like English hotel soup. Nowhere, thank
//heaven!
//1 Watery — âîäÿíèñòûé. 2 Îí ìîã áû äîáàâèòü: “or Scotch beef, or Welsh mutton.”

//Hob: Do you know the story of the man who was having soup
//in an English hotel? The waiter gave it to him and then, looking
//out of the window, said to the man, “It looks like rain, sir.”1
//“Yes,” said the man, as he took a spoonful of soup, “and it
//tastes like rain, too.”
//Jan: Soup doesn’t matter to me if I get some good beef and
//potatoes and then some bread and cheese and butter. After a
//lunch like that, I can work all day.
//Hob: After a lunch like that, I can sleep all afternoon.
//Pedro: The hotel that I am staying at is really quite good.
//We have...
//Hob (again interrupting): Talking about hotels, do you know
//this story about King George III of England? He was in the country
//one day and stopped at a small hotel for lunch. He wasn’t very hungry, so he had only two boiled eggs. He ate them and asked for the
//bill. The landlord gave him the bill — two pounds. The King said,
//“What! Two pounds for two eggs? Eggs must be very scarce here.”
//THE BILL
//1 It looks like rain îçíà÷àåò «Ïîõîæå, ñîáèðàåòñÿ äîæäü». Ïîñåòèòåëü âêëàäûâàåò â ñëîâà äðóãîé ñìûñë: «Ñóï ïîõîæ íà äîæäåâóþ âîäó, è âêóñ ó íåãî, êàê ó äîæäåâîé âîäû».

//“No, sir,” said the landlord, “eggs are not scarce — but kings
//are.”
//Lucille: Oh, Hob, that’s an old story. You will see it in every
//English book for foreign students. We can’t laugh at that.
//Hob: Oh, you ought to be like my Uncle Ben.
//Lucille: Why, what is so good about him?
//Hob: I’ll tell you. Here is a little poem that I wrote about
//him and his wife Berta:
//UNCLE BEN AUNT BERTA
//“A dear old man is my Uncle Ben,
//He knows the joke but he laughs again,
//He’s quite unlike his wife, Aunt Berta,
//Who looks as if the joke has hurt her.”
